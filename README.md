# MIPS-Multicycle
This is out project for computer architecture lab at school of computer engineering in university of Tehran.

This project supports following features:
* Multicycle pipeline with instruction fetch, instruction decode, execution, memory, and write back stages.
* Hazard detection unit
* Forwarding unit
* Using embedded-SRAM of FPGA as memory unit
* Using a two-way set-associative cache to speed-up memory access
